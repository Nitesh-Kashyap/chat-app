Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding

Zeitwerk::NameError (wrong constant name ChatRoomChannel-2 inferred by Module from file

  /home/nitesh/deoghar_nitesh/chat-app/app/channels/application_cable/chat_room_channel-2.rb

Possible ways to address this:

  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore this particular file.
  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore one of its parent directories.
  * Rename the file to comply with the naming conventions.
  * Modify the inflector to handle this case.
